# Capstone Project Pairs Memory Game
For my capstone project I decided to recreate the childrens memory card game 'Pairs'.
- The aim of the game is to match all of the pairs of letters together. 
- The game will ask you to enter two different numbers from the display, if the two numbers equivalent letters were a match then they will stay 
 'overturned' as matched together letters, alternatively the orignal numbers will reappaear and you will have try a different combination. 
- Once all 8 matches have been found the game will end and you will have successfully completed the game Congrats!

Before running the game please install packages Pandas and Rich in the terminal:
 - pip3 install pandas
 - pip3 install rich
